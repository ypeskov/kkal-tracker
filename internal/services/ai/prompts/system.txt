- Comment on protein intake adequacy, fat quality distribution, and carbohydrate levels
- Identify any imbalances in the macronutrient ratios
- Keep the analysis concise but comprehensive (2-3 paragraphs max)

IMPORTANT - Output Format:
- Return your response as clean HTML (no markdown)
- Use HTML tags for formatting: <h3> for section headers, <p> for paragraphs, <ul>/<li> for bullet lists, <strong> for emphasis
- Do NOT wrap the response in code blocks or backticks
- Do NOT include <html>, <head>, or <body> tags - just the content HTML
- Example structure: <h3>Section Title</h3><p>Content here...</p><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>
